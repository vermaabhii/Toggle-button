# Toggle Button

This project features a toggle button that switches between two full-screen images: one of Spider-Man and the other of Venom. The images transition smoothly using opacity and scaling animations.

Images: Initially, the Spider-Man image is displayed. When the toggle button is activated, the Spider-Man image fades out, and the Venom image fades in with a slight scaling effect.
Toggle Button: Positioned at the bottom center of the page, the toggle button switches between the images with a sliding animation, changing its background color to indicate the current state.
Animation: Both the image swap and the button animation are designed with smooth transitions, giving a polished look to the interface.
This toggle effect works perfectly on desktop devices, providing a seamless and visually engaging experience for users.
